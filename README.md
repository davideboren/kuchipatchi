Tamagotchi/Digimon "fishbowl" using Arduino/Teensy and SSD1306 0.96" OLED.

No care required! Monsters hatch and roam around, evolving on their own.

Uses 16x16 LCD sprites from original Tamagotchi/Digimon V-pets as well as sprites from other Digimon simulators made by people better at art than me.
