Tamagotchi/Digimon "fishbowl" using Arduino/Teensy and SSD1306 0.96" OLED.

No care required! Monsters hatch and roam around, evolving on their own.

Uses 16x16 LCD sprites stolen from original Tamagotchi/Digimon V-pets as well as other digimon simulators made by people who are better at spritework than me.
